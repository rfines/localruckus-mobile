					The following describes the terms by which Local Ruckus, LLC, owner and creator of the Local Ruckus service,
					offers you access to our website, platform and services:</Label>
				<Label class="heading">1. Acceptance of Terms</Label>
				<Label class="body">
					Local Ruckus, LLC ("Local Ruckus") provides a collection of online resources, including search, browse,
					user profile pages, event detail pages, business profile pages, performer profile pages, comments, link
					sharing, tags, calendar tools, data input tools, and Web Services application programming interfaces (APIs),
					(collectively referred to hereafter as "the Service") subject to the following Terms of Service ("Terms"),
					which may be updated by Local Ruckus from time to time. Local Ruckus will provide notice of materially
					significant changes to the Term by posting notice on the Local Ruckus site. You can review the most current
					version of the Terms at:
					<Label id="termsLink" onClick="showTerms">Terms of Use </Label>
					By using the Service in any way, you are agreeing to comply with these Terms. In addition, when using
					particular Local Ruckus services, you agree to abide by any applicable posted guidelines for all Local Ruckus
					services, which may change from time to time. Should you object to any term or condition of these Terms,
					any guidelines, or any subsequent modifications thereto or become dissatisfied with the Service in any way,
					your only recourse is to immediately discontinue use of the Service.
				</Label>
				<Label class="heading">2. Content</Label>
				<Label class="body">You understand that all postings, messages, text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, or other materials
					("Content") posted on, transmitted through, or linked from the Service, are the sole responsibility of the
					person from whom such Content originated. More specifically, you are entirely responsible for all Content
					that you post, email or otherwise make available via the Service. You understand that Local Ruckus does
					not control, and is not responsible for Content made available through the Service, and that by using the
					Service, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise
					objectionable. Furthermore, the Service and Content available through the Service may contain links to
					other websites, which are completely independent of Local Ruckus. Local Ruckus makes no representation
					or warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or authenticity of the information contained in any such
					site. Your linking to any other websites is at your own risk. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all
					risks associated with, the use of any Content, that you may not rely on said Content, and that under no
					circumstances will Local Ruckus be liable in any way for any Content or for any loss or damage of any kind
					incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed or otherwise made available via the Service.
					You acknowledge that Local Ruckus does not pre-screen or approve Content, but that Local Ruckus shall
					have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse, delete or move any Content that is
					available via the Service, for violating the letter or spirit of the Terms or for any other reason.</Label>
				<Label class="heading">3. Local Ruckus Communications</Label>
				<Label class="body">In the course of providing you services, Local Ruckus will communicate with you via email. You agree to
					receive emails which are specific to your account and necessary for the normal functioning of the Local
					Ruckus Service, including but not limited to notifications about performers and events you've expressed
					interest in. Local Ruckus will use the email address you provide to register you to use our Services, to verify

					your authority to use certain features of our Site and Services, to deliver certain services and notices based
					on the email settings you have selected, or to improve and tailor the content and general administration of
					our Site and Services.

					group of individuals on the basis of religion, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, age, or disability.

					conflict of law provisions. You and Local Ruckus agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of
					the courts located within the county of Platte, Missouri. The failure of Local Ruckus to exercise or enforce
					any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of

					court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other
					provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the
					contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the Terms must be
